# Udacity's Memory Game Project

## About the project
This is my 3rd project during the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
Students were given a [started code from Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) to complete the following tasks:
- add functionality to handle clicks
- complete matching logic
- define winning condition and create a congratulations popup
- include restart button, star rating, timer and move counter
- make design responsive for desktop, tablet, and phone browsers

## Install
Download project folder and open index.html in any browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).

## Game instructions

As a player, you have to match two cards to reveal them in during the game. If all cards match, you win!
Your star rating depends on the number of moves you make to complete the game:
 - 3 stars - less than 25 moves.
 - 2 stars - between 25 - 50 moves.
 - 1 star - more than 50 moves.

Click the button to play again on the winning popup.

**Good Luck**
